### Description:

Structuring an app is like building a house 🏡, many decisions 🤯 many views, many perspectives 🧐, it can be a personal choice or teams vote. Folder structure also plays a vital role. The questions in mind always are where should this file reside or which folder this file should go, what should I name the folder, component, hook, context 🤔

It's the developer way of life

Normally, I would choose the [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) to create an app from the base, as it's easy & we can start running that app as quickly as possible. Starting with package.json

## package.json

```json
{
  "name": "app-name",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "dependencies": { },
	"devDependencies": { }
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
		"build": "react-scripts build",
		"test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject",
		"lint": "eslint src/**/*.js",
    "lint:fix": "eslint src/**/*.js --fix",
    "stylelint": "stylelint src/**/index.css",
    "stylelint:fix": "stylelint src/**/index.css --fix",		
		"📦": "bundlesize",
		"prettification": "prettier --write \"**/*.js\""
  },
	"lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,jsx}": [
      "npm run prettification",
      "git add"
    ]
  },
	"husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": [
        "lint-staged"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## scripts

Here is where the magic 🎩 lies, all the good things happen here

- build the app
- style the app
- test the app
- prettify the app 🥳
- lint the app 😖
- and many more

### Some tips for `scripts` in pacakge.json

The script name should be easy to remember and small, Avoid using large names like `build:then:check:what:happened`

```json
"scripts": {
	"build:then:check:what:happened": "react-scripts build",
	"are:we:building:then:check:what:happened": "react-scripts build"
}
```

My choice: using emoji 😉 as a script name. Let me know if you're favorite emoji for deploying the code.

When I use Tailwind CSS, I tend to name the script as `build:style`, so it's easy to identify that it's a style related task, you can also name it to be specific to the framework/library like `build:tailwind` and that would even easier

```jsx
"scripts": {
  "build:style": "tailwind build index.css -o app.css"
}

```

Use `:` instead of `-` for script name, this will make the script name neat & crisp and also readable 👍 The `-` is for package names & `:` is for script names 😉

### Other or main stuff in `scripts`

Linting, Prettifying, Testing your app & Checking the bundle size is the part & parcel of app developing. To avoid code formatting issues, I have enabled the pre-commit hook with the leverage of prettier. I use `eslint` for linting JS, JSX and I use `stylelint` for linting the styles and `prettier` to format the code and to keep a tab on the bundle size, I use `bundlesize`.

Code splitting using React Lazy, Suspense & React Router and I try to keep each *.js in the build to be less than 500kb 😱 which sometime is not possible 🤯

## Folder structure

I follow the Atomic Design Methodology, I follow `Atoms` strictly and then bring them together in `Organisms`, then directly to `Pages`. Following the Atomic Design methodology will help you in many things while developing the project.

- Less repeated code in components, this reduces the inconsistency between the components
- The time to build an Organism or a Page will be faster 🚀
- The style guide for the project will reside in `theme.js`, The color palette, spacing, font families, font sizes, line heights, margin, padding, flex, grid and many more

### Atoms

Atoms are the smallest components, like Buttons, Heading, Input, Dropdown, Icon, Tags. This plays an important role in any app. The whole state of the app mainly starts from here.

### Organisms

Organisms are a combination of Atoms like Header, Card, Search Box with Icon, List Item,  and many more. Once you spend planning, designing the `Atoms`, the amount you spend on Organisms will be lesser. 

### Pages

Pages can be a combination of Atoms, Organisms or only Organisms depends on the UX design. It can be many cards with a header having a search box and some buttons.

If the components are designed in the above methodology, the  time taken to build a Component will be lesser and this is not a one time process where everything will done at one go, this will get better in time ⏰, with multiple design iterations, discussions and different approaches by different people 😉

### Detailed folder structure of the components

## Styling

Normally i shuffle between [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) or < 💅> [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) based on the project requirements.

### Tailwind CSS

If I choose Tailwind CSS I tend to choose only the needed options in `tailwind.config.js` and  nmae the npm script as `build:style` to build the styles. Naming the script `build:style` will help in identifying that it's a build method for styling purpose 😃

### < 💅> styled-components

### theme.js

```json
export const theme = {
	breakpoints: [32, 48, 64],
	space: [0, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 128, 256, 512],
	fontSizes: [12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 36, 48, 80, 96],
	fontWeights: [100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900],
	lineHeights: {
		normal: 1,
		title: 1.25,
		paragraph: 1.5
	},
	letterSpacings: {
		normal: 'normal'
	},
	colors: {
		black: '#000',
		white: '#fff',
		transparent: 'transparent',
		background: '',
		blue: '',
		lightblue: '',
		lighterblue: '',
		lightestblue: '',
		gray: '',
		darkgray: '',
		red: ''
	},
	radii: ['0px', '2px', '4px', '8px', '16px', '48px']
	// ... and many things
};
```

## Hosting

I choose [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host all the apps, Netlify is easy and make things easy around deployment 🚀
