Structuring an app is like building a house, many decisions 🤯 many views, many perspectives, it can be a personal choice or teams vote. Folder structure also plays a vital role. The questions in mind always are where should this go or which folder this file should go, what should I name the folder, component, hook, context 🤔

> It's the developer way of life

Normally, I would choose the [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) to create an app from the base, as it's easy & we can start running that app as quickly as possible.  Starting with package.json

## package.json

```json
{
  "name": "app-name",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "dependencies": { },
  "devDependencies": { }
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject",		
    "📦": "bundlesize",
    "prettification": "prettier --write \"**/*.js\""
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,jsx}": [
      "npm run prettification",
      "git add"
    ]
  },
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": [
        "lint-staged"
      ]
    }
  },
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": "react-app"
  }
}
```

## scripts

Here is where the magic 🎩 lies, all the good things happen here

- build the app
- style the app
- check the app
- test the app
- prettify the app 🥳
- and many more

The script name should be easy to remember and small, I don't tend to use large names like 

```json
"scripts": {
	"build:then:check:what:happened": "react-scripts build",
	"are:we:building:then:check:what:happened": "react-scripts build",
}
```

My choice: using emoji 😉 as a script name where you like, duplicate it again for the non-emoji script name.

When I use Tailwind CSS, I tend to name the script as `build:style`

```jsx
"scripts": {
  "build:style": "tailwind build index.css -o app.css"
}

```

Use `:` instead of `-` for script name, this will make it look neat & crisp and also read better 👍

## Folder structure

I follow the Atomic Design Methodology, I follow `Atoms` strictly and then bring them together in `Organisms`, then directly to Pages. 

![](./Atomic_Design.jpg)

### Atoms

Atoms are the smallest components, like Buttons, Heading, Input, Icon, Tags.

### Organisms

### Pages

### Detailed folder structure of the components

```markdown
📦src
 ┣ 📂components
 ┃ ┣ 📂atoms
 ┃ ┃ ┣ Heading.js
 ┃ ┃ ┣ Input.js
 ┃ ┃ ┣ Icon.js
 ┃ ┃ ┣ Tag.js

 ┣ 📂tests
 ┣ 📂utils
 ┣ App.js
 ┣ constants.js
 ┣ index.js
 ┣ serviceWorker.js
 ┣ setupTests.js
 ┗ theme.js
```

## Styling

Normally i shuffle between [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) or < 💅> [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) based on the project.

### Tailwind CSS

If I choose Tailwind CSS I tend to choose only the needed options in `tailwind.config.js` and  nmae the npm script as `build:style` to build the styles. Naming the script `build:style` will help in identifying that it's a build method for styling purpose 😃

### < 💅> styled-components
