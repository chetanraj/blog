Was a newbie to node.js, whenever I make a change in the code, In the terminal i used to keep on hitting Ctrl+C and then Up Arrow and restart the server.

After few days, found out [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon), basically nodemon monitors any code changes in your node app and it automatically restarts the server.

### Steps to use nodemon in any node app

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

and

```bash
nodemon ./server.js localhost 3000
```

the port number is optional and app specific, if the application accepted a host and port as the arguments, then itâ€™s yours.

nodemon also supports running and monitoring [coffee-script](http://coffeescript.org/) apps

```bash
nodemon server.coffee
```

NOTE: If no script is given, nodemon will look for the package.json file and if exists, the nodemon will run the file associated with the main property.
