[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a website holder for you & your projects. You can host your code directly from your GitHub repo. This article will help you how to manage your app in the `master` branch and deploy the code in the `gh-pages` branch easily.

You can choose any front-end framework like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.com/), [Next](https://nextjs.org/), [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/), and build the app in the master branch and build the code using the `npm run build` command and host directly using the `gh-pages` branch.

The quickest way to put your app to GitHub Pages is by using a package - [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages).

```js
npm i gh-pages -D
```

or you can install the package globally

```js
npm i gh-pages -g
```

Add this simple script to your package.json

```json:title=package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "npm run build && gh-pages -d dist"
  }
}
```
**Note**: Assuming the build folder to be `dist`

When you run `npm run deploy` all the contents of the build folder will be pushed to your repositoryâ€™s gh-pages branch. 

## If you are creating a **User page in GitHub**

Create a repository with your username likeÂ `username.github.io`, Create a branch called `code` or you can name the branch anything. Build the app in this branch and when it comes to deploying the app use the `gh-pages` command to push the build folder contents to the gh-pages branch

**Note**: In this case, you need to push your build directory toÂ `master`Â branch, use the following command

```json:title=package.json
{
	"scripts": {
		"deploy": "npm build && gh-pages -d dist -b master",
  }
}
```

After runningÂ `npm run deploy`Â you should see your website atÂ `http://username.github.io`

> Run _**gh-pages --help**_ to list all the supported options of the gh-pages package

## Useful npm scripts of gh-pages

If your source code of the app is in a private repository, create a public repository named about, the source code will reside in the private repository and the static content generated from the build will go into the public repository

```json:title=package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "npm run build && gh-pages -d dist --repo <url>",
  }
}
```

Deploy to another branch [which is not gh-pages]

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "gridsome build && gh-pages -d dist -b master",
  }
}
```

To include dotfiles while pushing the changes to the branch

```json:title=package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "npm run build && gh-pages -d dist -t"
  }
}
```

To change the commit message when publishing the change

```json:title=package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "npm run build && gh-pages -d dist -m Build 21082020v1"
  }
}
```
